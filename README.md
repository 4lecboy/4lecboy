# Hi, I'm Newelle Alec R. Quiambao! 👋
I'm a 4th-year BS Information Technology student at Our Lady of Fatima University (OLFU) and an aspiring Full-Stack Developer. Passionate about solving real-world problems through technology, I’m on a continuous journey to deepen my knowledge and skills in web development, backend development, and gesture recognition systems.

🚀 Current Focus
🌐 Full-Stack Development: Learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to build end-to-end web applications.
🛠 Backend Development: Exploring AWS to understand cloud computing and server-side development.
🖥 Capstone Project: Developing "TechTalk", a gesture-to-speech conversion system for the mute and deaf community using ESP32, TensorFlow Lite, and Arduino.
📚 What I'm Studying
Web Development: Mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and diving into modern frameworks.
Human Nature & Critical Thinking: Exploring emotional intelligence, effective communication, time management, and problem-solving.
Embedded Systems & IoT: Leveraging ESP32-C3 for innovative hardware projects like my capstone.
